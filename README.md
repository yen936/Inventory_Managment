# Inventory Management System
> Lightsaber Inventory Management  System built with JavaFX 11 and JavaDoc Documentaion

## Usage example


Inventory Management  System (IMS) is built with JavaFX 11 SDK using FMXL markup language. It impliments the Model View Controller architecture to increase readability. IMS has two major classes--Part and Products. The abstract class Part is sub classed by Inhouse & Outsourced each adding context to the parts origin. Each Product object is made up of Parts that are defined within IMS. 

IMS comes with preloaded Parts and Products, but users can add, modify, and delete any object to their hearts content. Below is showing adding a new Product: "Luke's Saber".


## Senerio

I am working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. Members of the organization have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like me to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.


## Development setup

IMS can be run most easily from an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA

or direct from command line with the JRE

```
javac Main.java
java Main
```


## Competencies

1. Classes and Interfaces
The graduate designs software solutions with appropriate classes, objects, methods, and interfaces to achieve specific goals.

2. Object-Oriented Principles
The graduate implements object-oriented design principles (e.g., inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction) in developing applications for ensuring the applicationâ€™s scalability.

3. Application Development
The graduate produces applications using Java programming language constructs to meet business requirements.

4. Exception Handling
The graduate incorporates simple exception handling in application development for improving user experience and application stability.

5. User Interface Development
The graduate develops user interfaces to meet project requirements.

6. Requirements Reading
I intreptered the requirements, gathering client needs and built according to them--while still optimizing preformance.
